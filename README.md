# Instructions
**Basics**
1) Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Install The Python discord support (> pip install discord.py)

**The Bot**
1) Create a Discord bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2) In the portal go to **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents** and turn them all on (allows the bot to send messages).
3) In the portal go to **OAuth2 > OAuth2 URL Generator** and click **bot > Administrator** to give your bot the right priviledges. Click copy at the bottom and paste it into your browser. Here you can add the bot to the discord server.
4) Download my `main.py` and `valid_words.txt` into the same folder (so the code knows where to look, or change the path in the code).
5) In the portal go to **Bot > Token > Reset Token** and copy the token. Paste it into the **TOKEN** value in `main.py`.
6) Run the bot. As long as the code is running the bot should work.
7) EXTRA: you can choose to run the code 24/7 on some platform.

# Help
Im pretty sure nothing could go wrong unless the code gets outdated or something.
